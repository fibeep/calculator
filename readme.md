#Simple Financial Calculator
The code presented in this repo will prompt the user with a few questions in regards to their finances.
It will then take the input from the user to compute a formula decided by the creator in order to determine
whether they are spending their money wisely. 
It will then ask the user how much money they would like to save up eventually and tell them whether their current 
job pays enough to achieve this or if not, how much more money they would have to make.
